                <p>I'm a recent graduate from The University of Washington Bothell's graduate certificate program in software engineering. I've spent my summer traveling a bit and visiting family and I'm now looking forward to finding an entry level position as a junior software developer. Originally I set out to work in the medical field and attained a bachelor's in Biological Sciences from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. After aquiring my undergraduate degree, I realised that my passion for the medical field never really developed and I really just enjoyed the sciences. It took a year of self reflection and I decided to pursue a career in the one thing I've always enjoyed... computers! So here I am now, I've moved myself to Seattle where there are numerous opportunities in hopes that I can grow my career as a software developer. In my spare time I also work on making video games. I'm currently working on Mop Master (it's as exciting as it sounds) in order to build a strong foundation for future projects.</p>
